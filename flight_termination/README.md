## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UMUAS/Nav2023-2024.git
    ```

2. Create, then activate a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install Dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd Nav2023-2024/flight_termination
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run this command to add a system environment variable called PYTHONPATH to allow importing our custom packages from anywhere:
    - Note: To have this setup for all terminal sessions, add the below command to your shell configuration file called `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for Bash, or `~/.zshrc` for Zsh. For example:
        1. Open the configuration file: `vim ~/.bash_profile`
        2. Add the command below to the end of the file, then save the file.
        3. Restart your terminal or apply the changes to the current shell: `source ~/.bash_profile`

    ```bash
    export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/Nav2023-2024/flight_termination/src/"
    ```
